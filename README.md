# [Simple Stocks](https://inst-377-final-project-five.vercel.app/stocks.html)



## Description
This website will utilize Polygon and frankfurter API tools to to display real-time stock prices on a dashboard. We have implemented an interactive stock ticker and different charts as descriptive representations. This output is crucial for our varied stakeholders (small investors and financial analysts) who rely on accurate and
up-to-date stock information in order to make their decisions on market matters.
## Targeted Browsers 

### Android Users (Chrome)

* Many Android users rely on Google Chrome as their primary browser. Our your website will performs well here, as Android devices have varying screen sizes and resolutions. Scaling charts and interactive displays appropriately has been a major focus through testing. 
* Using strategies such as conditional CSS and optimizing file sizes to allow devices with lower hardware capabalities to access the web application smoothly. 

### Desktop Users (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)

* Our most optimized targeted browser and platform are desktop users due to our scope and design process. Ultimately, having a larger display for detailed charts and analytics is ideal for our stakeholders. 
* Keyboard and mouse interactions such as hovering, shortcuts and persistent navigation provide an edge in usability.
